# README

This is the backend or API side of the Palettize App. To get started, fork and clone this repo onto your local machine. Then you'll need to run rake db:migrate and rake db:seed. Lastly you can run rails s to start the server. Next you'll want to go to the frontend of the application and get it running!

Access the frontend here: https://github.com/climb719/palettize-frontend
